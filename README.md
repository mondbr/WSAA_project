# **Web Services and Applications** 

by Monika Dabrowska

This repository is for the project component of the WSAA module for the Programming for Data Analytics module in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course at ATU in the summer semester of 2024/25.

The requierement of the project is to *write a program that demonstrates that you understand creating and consuming RESTful APIs*

The purpose is to create a web-based application that performs **CRUD operations** via a **REST API**, with an interface that dynamically interacts with a **mySQL** database.

The key goals are:
* Implement a RESTful backend with Flask.
* Build a responsive frontend to work with API using AJAX.
* Link the application to a database to work on data.
* Optionally, integrate an external data source and host the solution     online.

As my approach to this project, I created a personal finance tracker web app using **Flask**, **MySQL**, and **JavaScript**
It has an easy-to-use frontend that interacts with a **RESTful API** to perform real-time **CRUD** operations. The backend uses a **MySQL** database, and it connects to [freecurrencyapi](https://freecurrencyapi.com/) to real-time convert expenses from Euro to Dollar. 
I deployed the app on PythonAnywhere so itâ€™s accessible online anytime for demonstration.
